# Webpack Template

This is a simple Webpack template for building JavaScript applications. It includes basic configuration files for development and production environments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

 - `git clone https://github.com/argf013/webpack-template.git`

2. Install dependencies:

-  `cd webpack-template`
-  `npm install`

3. Start the development server:
-  `npm start`

This will launch the development server at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Building for Production

This will create a `dist` directory containing the minified and optimized production build.
